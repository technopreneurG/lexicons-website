In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of lexemes. The word \"lexicon\" derives from the Greek \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd (lexicon), neuter of \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (lexikos) meaning \"of or for words.\"\n\n\nfuther reading:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon\n\n\nInspiration:\n\n\n\n\nLong long ago there used to be a Y!Lexicon page on Yahoo! interanets, it was very useful for new hires to get introduced to various terminologies used inside Yahoo!.\n\n\nThe \nawesome lists\n, a great way of organising knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nList of Lexicons:\n\n\n\n\nComputational linguistics\n\n\nArtificial neural networks\n\n\nCloud Computing",
