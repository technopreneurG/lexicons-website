In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of lexemes. The word \"lexicon\" derives from the Greek \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd (lexicon), neuter of \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (lexikos) meaning \"of or for words.\" futher reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon Inspiration: Long long ago there used to be a Y!Lexicon page on Yahoo! interanets, it was very useful for new hires to get introduced to various terminologies used inside Yahoo!.

Particularly, they are inspired by the behaviour of neurons and the electrical signals they convey between input (such as from the eyes or nerve endings in the hand), processing, and output from the brain (such as reacting to light, touch, or heat). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network BP (Backpropagation) Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate a gradient that is needed in the calculation of the weights to be used in the network. Backpropagation is shorthand for \"the backward propagation of errors,\" since an error is computed at the output and distributed backwards throughout the network\u2019s layers. It is commonly used to train deep neural networks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation Tags: Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks Feedforward neural network In this network the information moves in only one direction-forward, From the input nodes data goes through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network. Feedforward networks can be constructed from different types of units, e.g. binary McCulloch-Pitts neurons, the simplest example being the perceptron. Continuous neurons, frequently with sigmoidal activation, are used in the context of backpropagation of error. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network Perceptron Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output. A perceptron follows the \"feed-forward\" model, meaning inputs are sent into the neuron, are processed, and result in an output. http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/ Tags: Classification Algorithms, Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks SGD (Stochastic gradient descent) Stochastic gradient descent (often shortened in SGD), also known as incremental gradient descent, is a stochastic approximation of the gradient descent optimization method for minimizing an objective function that is written as a sum of differentiable functions.
